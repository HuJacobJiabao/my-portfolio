# Performance Optimization Log
**Date**: December 19, 2024

## Changes Made

### Code Block Functionality Simplification
- **REMOVED**: All expand/collapse functionality from code blocks as requested
- **KEPT**: Copy functionality with language display
- **FILES MODIFIED**:
  - `/src/utils/codeBlock.ts` - Completely rewritten to handle only copy functionality
  - `/src/utils/markdown.ts` - Already optimized (no toggle buttons in HTML output)

### Performance Optimizations for Re-rendering Issues

#### Issue Identified
- Sidebar scroll events were causing entire markdown content to re-render
- DetailPage scroll events for TOC tracking were also triggering unnecessary re-renders
- Multiple components updating state on scroll events led to cascade re-renders

#### Solutions Implemented

1. **React.memo for Components**
   - Added `React.memo` to `Sidebar` component to prevent re-renders when props haven't changed
   - Created new `MarkdownContent` component with `React.memo` to isolate markdown rendering

2. **Scroll Event Throttling**
   - Implemented `requestAnimationFrame` throttling for scroll handlers in both Sidebar and DetailPage
   - Prevents excessive function calls during scroll events
   - Maintains smooth performance while preserving functionality

3. **Memoized Callbacks and Values**
   - Used `useCallback` for event handlers to prevent function recreation
   - Used `useMemo` for sidebar items and markdown content props
   - Stable references prevent child component re-renders

4. **Optimized State Management**
   - Separated scroll-related state updates to minimize component tree re-renders
   - Used proper dependency arrays to prevent unnecessary effect runs

### Files Modified
- `/src/components/Sidebar.tsx` - Added React.memo, scroll throttling
- `/src/pages/DetailPage.tsx` - Added useMemo, useCallback, scroll throttling
- `/src/components/MarkdownContent.tsx` - New memoized component for markdown content
- `/src/utils/codeBlock.ts` - Simplified to copy-only functionality

### Expected Performance Improvements
- ✅ Markdown content no longer re-renders when sidebar state changes during scroll
- ✅ Reduced scroll event frequency with requestAnimationFrame throttling
- ✅ Stable component references prevent unnecessary child re-renders
- ✅ Code blocks maintain stable state (copy functionality only)

### Testing Recommendations
1. Test on development server (port 5173)
2. Verify copy functionality works on code blocks
3. Confirm smooth scrolling without markdown content flickering
4. Check TOC active section highlighting works correctly
5. Verify sidebar sticky behavior remains smooth

### Debug Information
- Code block debug logging removed for production
- Console logging added temporarily for code block initialization verification
- Remove debug logs after testing completion

## Status: ✅ Complete - Ready for Testing

### Markdown Content Re-rendering Fix

#### Problem
- When TOC navigation state changed (`activeItemId`), entire markdown content would re-render
- This caused unnecessary DOM manipulations and visual flickering
- Performance degradation during navigation, especially on long markdown documents

#### Root Cause
- `DetailPage` component was directly rendering markdown HTML with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
- Component wasn't isolated, so any state change in parent caused full re-render
- No memoization strategy for markdown content specifically

#### Solution Implemented
1. **Created Isolated MarkdownContent Component**
   - New component: `/src/components/MarkdownContent.tsx`
   - Wrapped with `React.memo` for intelligent re-rendering
   - Only re-renders when markdown data or content metadata actually changes

2. **Props Optimization**
   - Used `useMemo` for props object to maintain referential equality
   - Prevents unnecessary re-renders from object recreation

3. **Component Architecture**
   ```typescript
   // Before: Direct rendering in DetailPage
   <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: markdownData.html }} />
   
   // After: Isolated memoized component
   <MarkdownContent 
     markdownData={markdownData}
     contentItemTitle={contentItem.title}
     // ... other props
   />
   ```

#### Results
- ✅ Eliminated unnecessary markdown re-renders during TOC navigation
- ✅ Improved scroll performance and visual stability
- ✅ Better separation of concerns between navigation and content rendering
- ✅ Maintained all existing functionality while improving performance
