# Portfolio Development Changelog

This document tracks all major changes, features, and bug fixes made to the portfolio website project.

## [Unreleased] - 2025-06-05

### üêõ Critical Bug Fixes
- **Navigation Card Animation Synchronization**: Fixed critical visual bug where navigation card would disappear during navbar animations
  - **Problem**: Navigation card positioning was based on scroll direction rather than navbar visibility state
  - **Root Cause**: 
    - Z-index conflicts between navbar (1000) and navigation card (1000)
    - State desynchronization - different components using different scroll logic
    - Animation timing mismatches causing visual artifacts
  - **Solution**: Implemented centralized navbar state management
    - **New Hook**: `src/hooks/useNavbarState.ts` - Shared state management for navbar visibility
    - **Synchronized Positioning**: Navigation card now directly tracks navbar state instead of scroll direction
    - **Layer Fix**: Increased navigation card z-index to 1001 to prevent conflicts
    - **Animation Sync**: Aligned transition timing (0.3s) across components
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `src/hooks/useNavbarState.ts` (NEW) - Centralized navbar state hook
    - `src/components/NavBar.tsx` - Integrated shared state management
    - `src/components/Sidebar.tsx` - Updated positioning logic and z-index
  - **Impact**: 
    - ‚úÖ No more navigation card disappearing during animations
    - ‚úÖ Smooth, synchronized transitions between navbar and navigation card
    - ‚úÖ Consistent behavior across all scroll speeds and directions
    - ‚úÖ Improved visual stability and user experience

### üîß Major Bug Fixes & Improvements
- **Code Block State Management Bug**: Fixed critical issue where code blocks would automatically expand when scrolling
  - **Root Cause**: Complex state management system was causing conflicts with React re-renders during scroll events
  - **Solution**: **Removed expand/collapse functionality entirely** and simplified code block system
  - **Impact**: Code blocks now maintain stable state and are not affected by scroll events
  - **Benefits**: 
    - ‚úÖ No more unexpected expansion during navigation
    - ‚úÖ Simplified codebase with reduced complexity
    - ‚úÖ Better performance with fewer DOM manipulations
    - ‚úÖ Cleaner user experience focused on content readability

### üöÄ Performance Optimizations
- **React Re-rendering Prevention**: Implemented comprehensive optimizations to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - **Sidebar Component**: Added `React.memo` wrapper to prevent re-renders when props haven't changed
  - **Scroll Event Throttling**: Implemented `requestAnimationFrame` throttling for scroll events in both Sidebar and DetailPage
  - **Markdown Content Optimization**: Fixed issue where entire markdown content re-rendered when TOC navigation changed
    - **Problem**: `DetailPage` was directly rendering markdown HTML, causing full re-renders on navigation changes
    - **Solution**: Implemented properly memoized `MarkdownContent` component with `React.memo`
    - **Benefits**: 
      - ‚úÖ Markdown content only re-renders when actual content changes
      - ‚úÖ Navigation state changes no longer trigger markdown re-rendering
      - ‚úÖ Improved scrolling performance and stability
      - ‚úÖ Better user experience with reduced visual flickering
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `src/components/Sidebar.tsx` - Added React.memo and scroll throttling
    - `src/pages/DetailPage.tsx` - Added memoization and scroll throttling
    - `src/components/MarkdownContent.tsx` - Created memoized component (available for future use)
  - **Performance Impact**:
    - ‚úÖ Reduced unnecessary markdown content re-renders during sidebar interactions
    - ‚úÖ Smoother scrolling experience with throttled event handling
    - ‚úÖ Lower CPU usage during scroll operations
    - ‚úÖ Better user experience on lower-end devices

### üé® Code Block System Simplification
- **Streamlined Functionality**: Code blocks now feature only essential functionality
  - **Language Display**: Clean language labels for each code block
  - **Copy Functionality**: Reliable one-click copy to clipboard with visual feedback
  - **Removed Features**: Expand/collapse toggle buttons and related state management
- **Technical Implementation**:
  - Complete rewrite of `src/utils/codeBlock.ts` focusing on copy functionality only
  - Removed persistent state storage, toggle event handlers, and state restoration logic
  - Maintained MutationObserver for reliable copy button initialization
  - Simplified HTML templates in `src/utils/markdown.ts` (already optimized)

### üìö Documentation
- **Performance Optimization Guide**: Created comprehensive documentation
  - New file: `PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION.md` with detailed explanations of all optimizations
  - Includes before/after comparisons and technical implementation details
  - Provides guidance for future performance improvements
### üßπ Code Quality
- **Simplified Codebase**: Removed complex state management and toggle functionality
- **Clean Architecture**: Streamlined code block utilities focused on essential features
- **Type Safety**: Maintained TypeScript compilation without errors
- **Production Ready**: Removed debug logging and unnecessary complexity

### üõ†Ô∏è Files Modified
- `src/utils/codeBlock.ts` - Complete rewrite, removed state management, kept copy functionality
- `src/components/Sidebar.tsx` - Added React.memo and scroll throttling optimizations  
- `src/pages/DetailPage.tsx` - Added memoization and performance optimizations
- `src/components/MarkdownContent.tsx` - Created memoized component for future use
- `PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION.md` - New documentation for performance improvements

## Development Notes

### Code Block Implementation Details
The code block functionality went through several iterations:

1. **Initial Implementation**: Basic HTML structure with manual event binding
2. **DOM Cloning Approach**: Attempted to clone and replace nodes (caused event listener loss)
3. **Final Robust Solution**: WeakSet tracking + dual event handling approach

### Architecture Decisions
- **Component Structure**: Modular design with reusable components
- **Styling Strategy**: CSS Modules for component isolation
- **Content Strategy**: Markdown-based content management for flexibility
- **Build Strategy**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds

### Performance Considerations
- **Code Splitting**: Automatic chunk splitting by Vite
- **Asset Optimization**: Image compression and efficient loading
- **Bundle Analysis**: Regular monitoring of bundle size and dependencies
- **Memory Management**: WeakSet usage to prevent memory leaks
