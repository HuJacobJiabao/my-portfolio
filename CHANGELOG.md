## [Unreleased] - 2025-06-05

### üßπ Production Optimization

#### 1. **Page Navigation Scroll Behavior Fix** - RESOLVED ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: When navigating to new pages, the page would visibly scroll to the top instead of starting at the top position
- **Root Cause**: Two conflicting scroll behaviors:
  1. Global `scroll-behavior: smooth` CSS setting caused animated scrolling during navigation
  2. `ScrollToTop` component used `window.scrollTo(0, 0)` which triggered the smooth scroll animation
- **Solution**: Implemented immediate positioning without scroll animation
  - **Temporary Smooth Scroll Override**: Disable smooth scrolling during route changes
  - **Immediate Positioning**: Use `document.documentElement.scrollTop = 0` for instant positioning
  - **Restore Smooth Scrolling**: Re-enable smooth scrolling for normal page interactions
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Modified `ScrollToTop` component to temporarily disable smooth scrolling
  - Used direct DOM manipulation for immediate scroll position reset
  - Added cleanup to restore original scroll behavior after positioning
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/App.tsx` - Enhanced ScrollToTop component with smooth scroll override
- **Benefits**:
  - Clean page loads without visible scrolling animation
  - Better user experience for navigation
  - Preserved smooth scrolling for normal page interactions

#### 2. **Debug Logging Removal**
- **Change**: Removed all debug console logging from SPA routing scripts for clean production build
- **Files Modified**:
  - `public/404.html` - Removed 3 console.log statements from redirect script
  - `index.html` - Removed 4 console.log statements from route restoration script
- **Benefits**:
  - Cleaner browser console for end users
  - Slightly reduced script size
  - More professional production environment
  - No functional changes to routing behavior

### üêõ Critical Bug Fixes

#### 3. **GitHub Pages SPA Routing Fix** - RESOLVED ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: Single Page Application routes would show 404 errors when accessed directly or refreshed
  - **Direct URL Access**: `https://hujacobjiabao.github.io/my-portfolio/project/` returned 404
  - **Page Refresh**: Refreshing any route other than homepage resulted in 404 error
  - **Deep Linking**: Sharing specific page URLs with others failed
- **Root Cause**: GitHub Pages static server was looking for physical HTML files that don't exist in SPAs
  - Only `/my-portfolio/index.html` exists
  - Routes like `/my-portfolio/project/` don't have corresponding HTML files
  - GitHub Pages returns 404 for missing files instead of falling back to index.html
- **Solution**: Implemented standard GitHub Pages SPA redirect strategy
  - **404.html Redirect**: Created redirect script that converts 404 errors into query-based redirects
  - **Route Restoration**: Enhanced index.html to detect and restore original URLs
  - **Build Process Fix**: Added explicit file copying to ensure 404.html deploys correctly
- **Production Optimization**: Removed debug console logging from routing scripts
- **Implementation Details**:
  - **404.html**: Redirects `/my-portfolio/project/` ‚Üí `/?/project/` (encoded format)
  - **index.html**: Detects encoded routes and restores original URL using `history.replaceState`
  - **Build Script**: Added `cp public/404.html dist/404.html` to prevent file clearing
  - **Debug Logging**: Removed all console output for clean production build
- **Files Modified**:
  - `public/404.html` (NEW) - GitHub Pages 404 fallback with redirect script
  - `index.html` - Added route restoration script in `<head>` section
  - `package.json` - Updated build command to ensure 404.html deployment
  - `src/App.tsx` - Added catch-all routes for better path handling
- **Testing Results**:
  - ‚úÖ Direct URL access works: `https://hujacobjiabao.github.io/my-portfolio/project/`
  - ‚úÖ Page refresh maintains correct route on all pages
  - ‚úÖ Browser back/forward navigation preserved
  - ‚úÖ Deep links can be shared successfully
  - ‚úÖ No impact on normal site navigation performance
- **Browser Compatibility**: 
  - ‚úÖ All modern browsers (History API support)
  - ‚úÖ IE10+ compatibility (404.html > 512 bytes)
  - ‚úÖ Mobile browsers fully supported
- **SEO Impact**: 
  - ‚úÖ Search engines see correct original URLs
  - ‚úÖ Social media link previews work correctly
  - ‚úÖ No duplicate content issues

#### 4. **Header Height Consistency & Title Display Optimization**
- **Issue**: Page headers had inconsistent heights causing layout jumps and poor UX
  - **Project Pages**: 281.59px header height
  - **Article Pages**: 518.25px header height  
  - **Title Font Reduction**: Titles reduced font size too aggressively instead of using line breaks
- **Root Cause**: 
  - No fixed height system caused headers to expand based on content
  - Font reduction triggered at low character thresholds (40, 60, 80 chars)
  - Title area didn't properly accommodate multi-line titles
- **Solution**: Implemented fixed header system with smart typography
  - **Fixed Heights**: 200px desktop, 220px mobile (reduced by 40-60px)
  - **Three-Area Structure**: Title area, metadata area, tags area with proper spacing
  - **Smart Title Logic**: Raised font reduction thresholds to 80/100/120 characters
  - **Enhanced Typography**: Increased metadata font sizes (+0.2rem across all elements)
- **Implementation Results**:
  - **Title Behavior**: Prioritizes line breaks over font size reduction
  - **Font Sizes**: Larger metadata text (0.9rem/1rem vs 0.7rem/0.8rem)
  - **Space Efficiency**: Smaller header with larger, more readable text
  - **Consistency**: Fixed heights eliminate layout jumps between page types
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/styles/Layout.module.css` - Header styling and responsive design
  - `src/components/Layout.tsx` - Dynamic title sizing logic
- **Testing Results**:
  - ‚úÖ Consistent header heights across all page types
  - ‚úÖ Titles wrap to multiple lines before reducing font size
  - ‚úÖ Better text readability with larger metadata fonts  
  - ‚úÖ Improved mobile experience with proportional scaling
  - ‚úÖ No layout shift when navigating between different content types

#### 5. **Navigation Card Animation Synchronization**
  - **Problem**: Navigation card positioning was based on scroll direction rather than navbar visibility state
  - **Root Cause**: 
    - Z-index conflicts between navbar (1000) and navigation card (1000)
    - State desynchronization - different components using different scroll logic
    - Animation timing mismatches causing visual artifacts
  - **Solution**: Implemented centralized navbar state management
    - **New Hook**: `src/hooks/useNavbarState.ts` - Shared state management for navbar visibility
    - **Synchronized Positioning**: Navigation card now directly tracks navbar state instead of scroll direction
    - **Layer Fix**: Increased navigation card z-index to 1001 to prevent conflicts
    - **Animation Sync**: Aligned transition timing (0.3s) across components
  - **Files Modified**:
    - `src/hooks/useNavbarState.ts` (NEW) - Centralized navbar state hook
    - `src/components/NavBar.tsx` - Integrated shared state management
    - `src/components/Sidebar.tsx` - Updated positioning logic and z-index
  - **Impact**: 
    - ‚úÖ No more navigation card disappearing during animations
    - ‚úÖ Smooth, synchronized transitions between navbar and navigation card
    - ‚úÖ Consistent behavior across all scroll speeds and directions
    - ‚úÖ Improved visual stability and user experience

### üîß Major Bug Fixes & Improvements
#### 1. **Code Block State Management Bug**: Fixed critical issue where code blocks would automatically expand when scrolling
  - **Root Cause**: Complex state management system was causing conflicts with React re-renders during scroll events
  - **Solution**: **Removed expand/collapse functionality entirely** and simplified code block system
  - **Impact**: Code blocks now maintain stable state and are not affected by scroll events
  - **Benefits**: 
    - ‚úÖ No more unexpected expansion during navigation
    - ‚úÖ Simplified codebase with reduced complexity
    - ‚úÖ Better performance with fewer DOM manipulations
    - ‚úÖ Cleaner user experience focused on content readability
