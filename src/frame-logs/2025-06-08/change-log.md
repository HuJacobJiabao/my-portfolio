# Change Log - June 8, 2025

## Summary
Updated application routing structure to use plural forms for better semantic consistency and renamed blog component file to match the new routing convention.

## Changes Made

### 1. Route Path Updates
Updated application routes to use plural forms for better semantic consistency:
- **Projects Route**: Changed from `/my-portfolio/project/` to `/my-portfolio/projects/`
- **Blog Route**: Changed from `/my-portfolio/blog/` to `/my-portfolio/blogs/`

### 2. File Rename
Renamed the blog page component file:
- **File Name**: Changed from `Blog.tsx` to `Blogs.tsx` to match the new plural routing convention

## Benefits

### ✅ Improvements
- **User Experience**: More intuitive navigation with plural route names that better represent collection pages
- **Developer Experience**: Consistent naming convention between routes and component files
- **Semantic Consistency**: Route paths now properly reflect that these are collection/listing pages

### ✅ Technical Benefits
- **Code Quality**: Improved consistency between file names, component names, and route paths
- **Architecture**: Better semantic structure with plural routes for collection pages
- **Maintainability**: Clearer naming convention reduces confusion for future development

## Files Modified
1. **`src/App.tsx`** - Updated route definitions and component imports
2. **`src/components/NavBar.tsx`** - Updated navigation links

6. **`src/utils/contentLoader.ts`** - Updated link generation for content items
7. **`src/pages/Blog.tsx`** → **`src/pages/Blogs.tsx`** - File renamed and moved

## Technical Details
- All route references updated from singular to plural forms
- Import statements and component references updated throughout codebase
- Content loader utility updated to generate correct navigation links
- Navigation components updated to use new route paths
- TypeScript compilation and build process verified successful

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: Test the updated routes in development environment to ensure all navigation works correctly
2. **Short-term**: Update any documentation or README files that reference the old route paths
3. **Long-term**: Consider implementing redirect rules for old routes to maintain backward compatibility if needed
