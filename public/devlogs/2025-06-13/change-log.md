# Change Log - June 13, 2025

## Summary
Today focused on implementing global color configuration for categories and tags across all pages (except home), and significantly improving table display on mobile devices. These changes provide a more cohesive visual design system and better mobile user experience.

<!-- Changes Made -->

## 1. Global Category and Tag Color Configuration
Implemented a comprehensive color configuration system in **config.yaml** under the content section that applies to all pages except the home page.

**Category Colors (Text Only):**
- Added `categoryColors` configuration with `textColor` property
- Supports multiple categories with custom text colors
- Includes `default` fallback color for unconfigured categories

**Tag Colors (Background + Text):**
- Added `tagColors` configuration with both `backgroundColor` and `textColor` properties  
- Supports multiple tags with custom styling
- Includes `default` fallback colors for unconfigured tags

**Helper Functions:**
- Created `getCategoryColor()` and `getTagColor()` functions in **config.ts**
- Automatic color lookup with fallback to default values
- Type-safe implementation with proper interfaces

**Component Updates:**
- ✅ **Card.tsx**: Updated for projects/blogs/archive pages
- ✅ **BlogCard.tsx**: Updated for blog listing display
- ✅ **TimelineItem.tsx**: Updated for archive page timeline
- ✅ **Archive page**: Category styling with transparent background and no borders

## 2. Mobile Table Display Optimization
Completely redesigned table rendering for mobile devices to provide a native table experience while ensuring proper responsive behavior.

**Unified Desktop/Mobile Experience:**
- Made desktop and mobile table styling consistent
- Both platforms now use the same table structure and behavior
- Eliminated separate card-based mobile layouts

**Responsive Design:**
- Tables maintain table structure on all screen sizes
- Added horizontal scrolling when content exceeds container width
- Implemented `table-layout: fixed` for better width control
- Used `word-wrap: break-word` to handle long content gracefully

**Scrollbar Enhancement:**
- Custom scrollbar styling for better visual appeal
- Always-visible horizontal scrollbars for clear scroll indication
- Webkit and Firefox browser compatibility

**Visual Improvements:**
- Simplified table header backgrounds for cleaner appearance
- Improved color contrast between headers and content
- Consistent border and spacing across all screen sizes

## Benefits

### Improvements
- **Visual Consistency**: Global color configuration ensures consistent category and tag styling across all pages
- **Mobile Experience**: Tables now display properly on mobile devices without content overflow
- **User Interface**: Cleaner, more professional table design with better visual hierarchy
- **Responsive Design**: Seamless table experience across all device sizes

### Technical Benefits
- **Maintainability**: Centralized color configuration reduces code duplication
- **Flexibility**: Easy to modify colors through YAML configuration without code changes
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript interfaces ensure proper configuration usage
- **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Consistent scrollbar styling across different browsers
