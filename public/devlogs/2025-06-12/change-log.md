# Change Log - June 12, 2025

## Summary
Completed comprehensive mobile responsive design improvements for the portfolio website, focusing on background display optimization, mobile navigation enhancement, and layout refinements. Successfully resolved global background issues and improved mobile user experience with better title positioning and metadata organization.

<!-- Changes Made -->

## 1. Global Background Style Consolidation
✅ Successfully moved all **backgroundFixed** styles from individual component modules to **App.css** for centralized management. Optimized global background rendering with proper mobile-specific adjustments including scroll attachment for better performance on mobile devices.

## 2. Mobile Title Positioning Enhancement
✅ Implemented **titleOnlyHeader** styling for mobile devices to ensure page titles (blogs, projects, archive, detail pages) are properly centered when no metadata is present. Applied mobile-specific height adjustments (180px) and improved vertical centering for better visual balance.

## 3. Layout Metadata Organization
✅ Reorganized header metadata display order in **Layout.tsx** to show Type as the final meta item, improving information hierarchy. Order now follows: Category → Created → Last Update → Type.

## 4. Background Display Fix
✅ Resolved background sizing issues by changing from viewport units (**100vw/100vh**) to percentage units (**100%**) in global background styles, eliminating scroll bar conflicts and positioning problems on mobile devices.

## Benefits

### Improvements
- **User Experience**: Mobile users now see properly centered titles and optimized background display across all devices
- **Visual Consistency**: Standardized background behavior eliminates display inconsistencies between different page types
- **Information Hierarchy**: Better organized metadata display improves content comprehension
- **Mobile Navigation**: Enhanced mobile responsiveness with proper title positioning and background rendering

### Technical Benefits
- **Code Quality**: Centralized background styles in App.css reduce code duplication and improve maintainability
- **Performance**: Optimized mobile background rendering with scroll attachment prevents performance issues on mobile devices
- **Architecture**: Cleaner separation of global styles from component-specific styling improves code organization
- **Responsive Design**: Comprehensive mobile-first approach ensures consistent experience across all screen sizes
