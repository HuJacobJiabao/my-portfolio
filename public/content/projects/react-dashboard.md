# React Analytics Dashboard

A comprehensive analytics dashboard built with React, TypeScript, and modern data visualization libraries.

## Overview

This project demonstrates modern React development practices with a focus on data visualization and user experience.

## Features

### ðŸ“Š Data Visualization
- Interactive charts using Chart.js and D3.js
- Real-time data updates
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

### ðŸŽ¨ Modern UI/UX
- Material Design components
- Dark/Light theme support
- Smooth animations and transitions

### âš¡ Performance
- Lazy loading components
- Virtual scrolling for large datasets
- Optimized bundle size

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite
- **Styling**: Styled Components, Material-UI
- **Charts**: Chart.js, D3.js, Recharts
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit, React Query
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library

## Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/     # Reusable UI components
â”œâ”€â”€ pages/         # Page components
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/         # Custom React hooks
â”œâ”€â”€ services/      # API services
â”œâ”€â”€ store/         # Redux store configuration
â””â”€â”€ utils/         # Helper functions
```

## Key Challenges

### Data Processing
Handling large datasets efficiently while maintaining smooth user interactions.

### Real-time Updates
Implementing WebSocket connections for live data updates without performance degradation.

### Accessibility
Ensuring all charts and components are accessible to users with disabilities.
